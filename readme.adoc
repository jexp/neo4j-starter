== A JVM based Management Library for Testing against Neo4j Instances

*Currently works only under Unix / OSX*

. Should work for Neo4j versions 1.9+
. Download specfic versions into a configurable directory, by default temp-dir or $HOME/.neo4j
. Determine free ports to run Neo4j on
. Extract and configure an insstance for that port / db-directory / etc.
. Configure port(s), memory (heap, page-cache), (di)sable shell, disable backup
. Start, Stop, Restart, Clean-DB, Remove an instance
. Provide fixtures: cypher-file, db-directory, cypher-statements

* try to mimic the API of http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/server-unmanaged-extensions-testing.html[neo4j-harness]*, esp. `ServerControls` and `Neo4jRule`
